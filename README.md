# Database Management
Repository of the database management final project on developing a database for a room house.

This repository contains all the .sql files as well as the documentation necessary for the final project of the CS 205 - Database Management course offered at Western Connecticut State University. This project's main purpose was to develop a database that would hold room information regarding a room house that contains different rooms and room types, and the database would be used by customers who would rent the rooms.

There are different versions of each document, demonstrating the process of developing a newer, better version of each individual aspect of the project.

To better understand the project, it is best to read-use the latest versions of each document and each .sql and .txt file.
